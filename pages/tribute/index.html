              <h3>Here are my favorite lines from some of his albums:</h3>
              <ul>
                <li>
                  <b>Operation: Doomsday 1999 </b>- "I sell rhymes like dimes. The one who mostly keep cash but brag about the broker times."
                </li>
                <li>
                  <b>Take Me to Your Leader 2003 </b>- "Nowadays it's amazing raising young. Rule number one: Keep your fazers on stun."
                </li>
                <li>
                  <b>Mm.. Food 2004 </b>- "If I had a dime for every rhymer that bust guns. I'll have a cool mill for my sons in trust funds."
                </li>
                <li>
                  <b>Madvillainy 2004 </b>- "Got more lyrics than the church got "Ooh Lords". And he hold the mic and your attention like two swords."
                </li>
                <li>
                  <b>The Mouse and the Mask 2005 </b>- "If you gonna hate, might at least get your rumors straight. About Doom the Great, a lot more confident. Came a long way since the days we had to rhyme for rent."
                </li>
                <li>
                  <b>Born Like This 2009 </b>- "Sickest ninja injury this century, enter plea. Lend sympathy to limper Simple Simon rhyming emcees."
                </li>
                <li>
                  <b>Key to the Kuffs 2012 </b>- "Catch a throatful from the fire vocaled. Ash and molten glass like Eyjafjallaj√∂kull."
